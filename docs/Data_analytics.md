# Data analysis for drug repositioning 

 A comprehensive data mining and analysis effort has been done to present these lists of existing drugs with therapeutic potentials for COVID-19. The analysis was based on different rationales including anti-coronavirus activity, broad-spectrum antiviral activity and antiviral drugs with highly conserved viral target such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). We will constantly update these lists with new discoveries.

## Data analysis results from previous other antiviral drug discovery records

A collection of drug candidates in pipelines or marketed for different antiviral indications. All candidates have at least completed Phase I studies. However, not all have in vitro anti-coronavirus or anti-2019nCoV evidence yet, further studies using 2019-nCoV specific assays are required to evaluate their anti-2019nCoV potential.
